# Bribery Experience in the Water and Sanitation Sector in Sub-Saharan Africa
The prevalence of bribery in the Water and Sanitation sector of Sub-saharan Africa is investigated in this work. The empirical analysis draws on data from the seventh round of Afrobarometerâ€™s public attitude survey. Data is restricted to respondents who reported having made contact with the government to obtain water and sanitation services in the last year.

## Key Findings
Out of all citizens who had contact with a public official to obtain water and sanitation services, 20% paid a bribe to obtain the service they required. This figure was higher for some countries than others.
