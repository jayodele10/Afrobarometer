# Bribery Experience in the Water and Sanitation Sector in Sub-Saharan Africa
The prevalence of bribery in the Water and Sanitation sector of Sub-saharan Africa is investigated in this work. 

## Data
The empirical analysis draws on data from the seventh round of Afrobarometerâ€™s public attitude survey. Data is restricted to respondents who reported having made contact with the government to obtain water and sanitation services in the last year. Invalid responses and observations with missing responses are also omitted from the sample. These restrictions produce a final sample size of 7457 respondents.

## Key Findings
1. Out of all citizens who had contact with a public official to obtain water and sanitation services, 20% paid a bribe to obtain the service they required. This figure was higher for some countries than others.  
2. Poorer respondents are more likely to experience having to pay bribes to obtain water and sanitation services than richer respondents. Those who lack basic necessities (high lived poverty) have 47.8% greater odds of bribery experience compared to those who have no-lived poverty (i.e. have never lacked any basic necessities). 
3. Respondents in rural areas are significantly less likely (15.8% lower odds) to be involved in bribery incidents than their counterparts in urban areas.
4. Respondents in the older age brackets have significantly lower odds of being involved in bribery incidents compared to respondents in the age bracket 18-25.
